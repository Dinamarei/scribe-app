I went back to order the same menu, order again, and my total price came to $72. I noticed that the prices were raised just slightly above 30% so my actual discount cost me $1 more than the regular price.

2023-03-19 17:43:02,What's the point of a business if you do not take customer complaints serious? This is the third time I've ordered food on the app and had delivery complications. I can't reach the rider and I'm literally telling you I'm not able to reach the rider and I get automated responses? How does that even help? The customer service really needs to be improved on. Like why can't I even call to make that complaint? It is just super frustrating. I totally won't recommend this app to anyone. Terrible customer service!,1,Angry complaint😡,Bolt Food,App Store,,,

I got to a new place and needed food so I downloaded the app to order some KFC. The rider wasn’t moving much on the map. I waited till a minute to estimated delivery time and called him after several tries before he picked up and wouldn’t speak when he did. Food never came and payment had already been made.

This is the first time in my life when I see increasing prices in 30-40% is called a “sale”. 

How is this possible that you consider a sale order with minimum price of 15€ to have free delivery in just 2km (you will eventually pay 15€ + delivery even if your order is less than 15€). 

I was ordering in your app daily. I am one person and usually I order in 8-12€ range INCLUDING delivery. And now I am forced to pay 15+€ via sale? I don’t even eat that much. 

Avsolutely disgusting pricing policy. Calling it “sale” feels like trolling... Didn’t expected you will be parasiting on COVID tragedy so bad. Especially while usually delivery in radius of 2km was free som time ago. Now I have to pay 15€. THANK YOU xD
